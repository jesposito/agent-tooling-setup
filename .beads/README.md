# Beads Directory

This directory would normally be managed by `bd` (Beads CLI).

Since we're on Windows without Beads installed, this is a placeholder to demonstrate the project structure.

On Linux/macOS or WSL, run:
```bash
bd init
```

This creates:
- `.beads/beads.db` - SQLite database of tasks
- `.beads/config.yaml` - Beads configuration
